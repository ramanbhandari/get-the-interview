# get-the-interview

This project aims to build a tool that analyzes relevant data of people who successfully landed jobs at top tech companies (FAANG). The goal is to identify key patterns and skills required for these roles and provide actionable suggestion for improving resume, not the format, but the value, projects, experience, skills etc., that can further enhance the probability of securing the interview, everything else from preparation for interview to negotiating the offer can come later.

## What's required to build this project?

Patience! But also:

1. Web Scraping
2. File Parsing
3. Handling Data Securely
4. Data Analysis
5. Machine Learning Models
6. Some Crappy Frontend Components (for now!)
