# GetTheInterview

The aim of this project is to build a tool that analyzes resume data from individuals who have successfully landed jobs at top tech companies (e.g., Google, Amazon, Meta, etc.). By identifying key patterns and required skills, the tool will provide *actionable* suggestions for improving the value of a resumeâ€”not just its format, but its projects, experience, and skills. This will help users enhance their resumes and improve their chances of securing an interview.

While the primary focus is on resume analysis, future enhancements could include features for interview preparation and offer negotiation.

## Project Goals

Data Collection: Gather publicly available resume data from individuals hired at top tech companies.
Data Analysis: Analyze the data to identify key trends, skills, and experiences in successful candidates.
Machine Learning (ML): Utilize ML models to predict and suggest resume enhancements that will improve the likelihood of securing an interview.
User Interface: Provide users with an intuitive web-based interface where they can input their resume and receive personalized suggestions.

## Technologies and Tools
### Backend
Python: Core language for data scraping, processing, and machine learning.
SQLite: Lightweight database to store and manage data.
### Machine Learning Models
Traditional ML Models:
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost using Scikit-learn and XGBoost libraries.
  
Deep Learning Models:
- BERT for advanced natural language processing using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.
  
Frontend
- React: For building a web interface where users can interact with the tool.

## Key Requirements
Building this project will require:

- Web Scraping: To collect public resumes from various sources.
- File Parsing: Extracting meaningful content from resumes (PDFs, text files).
- Data Security: Handling data responsibly and ensuring it is kept local and private.
- Data Analysis: Detecting patterns and trends in the data.
- Machine Learning: Implementing and training models to generate actionable suggestions.

And some patience!

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 Data Collection
- Scrape publicly available resumes.
- Store resumes securely and locally.

### Phase 2 Data Preprocessing
- Parse and clean the collected data.
- Extract key features like skills, experience, and job titles.


### Phase 3 Data Analysis and Visualization
- Analyze patterns in the data.
- Visualize trends across various roles and companies.

### Phase 4 Machine Learning Model
- Train traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Implement deep learning models (BERT) for text analysis.

### Phase 5 Web Interface
- Build a frontend with React for users to input resumes and receive feedback.

## Planning
### Machine Learning Models
